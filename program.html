                                    <p class="service-item-text">Abstract: The "virtual electrode" is an appealing metaphor as it suggests that we can - with the right tools and skills - use macroscopic recording techniques such as EEG or MEG to place an electrode anywhere in the brain, and record from it as if it were a real, microscopic electrode. Like every good metaphor, it can sometimes lead us astray.  In this talk I'll suggest that a more accurate metaphor - if less appealing - is that of a "virtual scalpel" by which activity from a source within the brain is suppressed within the macroscopic recording. With J channels, up to J-1 sources can be suppressed while still retaining some information about other sources. Interestingly, with appropriate source and forward models, it is possible to accurately locate any source within source space, as the intersection of the null sets of all the spatial filters that suppress it. A source separation method such as ICA offers J-1 such filters per source, potentially a very strong constraint on source location.</p>

                                    <p class="service-item-text">Abstract: Accurate delineation of the epileptogeneic zone (EZ) during presurgical workup of focal drug-resistant epilepsy patients is challenging. Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recordings, considered as the gold-standard for the localization of the EZ, is essential when mapping the seizure-onset zone (SOZ) and determining surgical candidacy. However, a successful investigation requires a strong pre-implantation hypothesis on the localization of the EZ, which can be derived from non-invasive investigations such as EEG or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging. The purpose of this talk is to introduce the Maximum Entropy on the Mean (MEM) source imaging framework, as a Bayesian approach to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of localizing the generators of EEG and MEG signals along the cortical surface. I will first review the time-domain version of MEM, which is sensitive to the spatial extent of the underlying generators, notably when localizing transient epileptic discharges. The localization accuracy of the MEM method and its ability to recover the spatial extent of the generators was quantitatively validated using SEEG (Abdallah Neurology 2022). I will then introduce the time-frequency wavelet-based extension of MEM (wavelet MEM) as a source image method of interest to localize transient oscillations, such as ictal oscillations localizing the seizure onset zone, transient high frequency oscillations and ongoing resting state oscillations. The accuracy of wavelet-based MEM to recover oscillatory power spectra or connectivity features from resting state MEG data was validated using the MNI SEEG atlas of normal brain activity (Afnan Neuroimage 2023) as ground truth and we reported interesting MEG resting state patterns able to predict postsurgical outcome in epilepsy (Aydin J. Neural Engineering 2020) . Finally, investigating sleep characteristics during prolonged recordings using high-density EEG or MEG is  also an important topic, where the generators of sleep specific discharges such as spindles or slow waves are spatially extended. MEM-based approaches are particularly appealing for spindle localization (Zerouali Front. In Neuroscience 2014) or when investigating interactions between sleep and epilepsy (Avigdor Ann Clin Transl Neurol. 2024).</p>

                                    <p class="service-item-text">Abstract: Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) offer high temporal resolution, making it possible to study directed and frequency-resolved interactions including different types of cross-frequency coupling. However, inevitable source mixing can cause spurious FC if not properly accounted for. In this talk, I will consider the problems of detecting and quantifying Granger causality, phase-amplitude coupling, signal transmission delays and complex network properties from M/EEG data in the presence of source mixing. I will present methods and simulation studies highlighting the capabilities and limitations of M/EEG based FC estimation. Finally, I will show normative functional M/EEG connectomes derived from large pediatric and adult cohorts and their dependance on age and gender. These normative connectomes are expected to become instrumental for characterizing pathological brain communication patterns.</p>

It will introduce community-developed resources and tools that support these practices throughout the entire research cycle, covering study inception and planning, data acquisition, research data management with an emphasis on standards, data processing and analysis, and research dissemination beyond publication. We will also reflect on more intangible aspects, including ethical implications a›nd the responsibility we scientists have in engaging with societal challenges. The aim is to encourage a commitment to collaborative, open, and reproducible M/EEG research, embracing good practices. Adhering to these principles can facilitate the generation of high-quality results, significantly contributing to advancing our understanding of neural traces and, ultimately, of the complex functioning of the human brain.</p>

                                    <p class="service-item-text">Abstract: Neural oscillations and evoked responses represent two main modes of electrophysiological activity (EEG/MEG) in the human brain, yet the link between them remains rather illusive. Here we present a unifying view on these two types of activity where evoked responses are generated by the amplitude modulation of neural oscillations with non-zero mean. We show how somatosensory, visual, motor and cognitive responses can be generated or affected by this baseline-shift mechanism (BSM). Moreover, we show how phase-amplitude coupling can be conceptualized through BSM, which in turn has implications for interpreting neural activity/interactions in basic and clinical research.</p>

I will show data suggesting that the neural traces of this memory decline are reduced alpha/beta desynchronization indicating reduced opportunities of information processing and imprecise coupling between theta phase and gamma power indicating reduced binding of information. Thus, a decline in the concerted interaction of oscillatory mechanisms during memory encoding and retrieval seems to be at the core of this prominent age-related memory decline.</p>

The objective is to improve our understanding of the physiological basis of cortical oscillations, partly challenging conventional spectral analyses that rely solely on canonical frequency bands.

                                        While the advent of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) has been highly effective for temporarily alleviating motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP), some individuals are left without experiencing optimal clinical benefits. Some proposed parameters that may augment the efficacy of STN-DBS are the directionality and magnitude of current administered throughout the device, albeit the precise neurophysiological mechanisms underlying clinically-effective DBS parameter settings are not well understood. Herein, PwP implanted with STN-DBS completed low-frequency monopolar stimulation paradigms of the left STN during MEG. Data were evaluated in the time-frequency domain and imaged using minimum norm estimation. Peak vertex time series data were then extracted from ipsilateral sensorimotor regions to interrogate the directional specificity and magnitude of STN-DBS current administration on evoked and induced cortical responses and quantitative motor outcomes using linear mixed-effects models. Our results demonstrated temporally- (evoked) and spectrally-specific (oscillatory) neurophysiological modulations based on the clinical efficacy of DBS programming strategies, with more effective settings such as clinically-useful contacts and stimulation amplitudes eliciting increases in sensorimotor evoked potentials, reductions in cortical beta synchrony, and better behavioral performance compared to suboptimal settings. Taken together, our data suggest that the brain-behavior dynamics pertinent to STN-DBS protocols as measured herein using simultaneous low-frequency DBS-MEG recordings, may serve as effective targets for guiding DBS parameter selection for optimized motor symptom improvement in PwP in the future.

The first step for an accurate estimation of functional connectivity from MEG data consists in the solution of the ill-posed MEG inverse problem, a step that requires different informed decisions by expert users. In this talk I will discuss the impact that some of these choices have on the final connectivity estimation, including for example the choice of the level of regularization within a minimum norm estimation framework (Vallarino et al, 2023) and the choice of the brain parcellation used for defining the brain areas (Brkić et al, 2023). Eventually, I will present a novel approach to tackle the problem. This approach consists in the solution of a novel inverse problem that will allow directly estimating the cross-power spectrum at source level from that computed by using the recorded MEG time series.</p>

Here, I will summarize findings from electro- and magnetoencephalographic studies in participants at clinical high risk for psychosis, patients with first-episode psychosis as well as patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to identify the pattern of deficits across illness stages, the relationship with clinical variables, and the prognostic potential. Finally, data on genetics and developmental modifications will be reviewed, highlighting the importance of late modifications of 40-Hz ASSRs during adolescence, which are closely related to the underlying changes in GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) interneurons. Together, our review suggests that 40-Hz ASSRs may constitute an informative electrophysiological approach to characterize circuit dysfunctions in psychosis that could be relevant for the development of mechanistic biomarkers.</p>

Her research aims to understand how, when, and why we mind-wander. She is also fascinated by how this mind-wandering process is adaptive--as in the case of creativity--and when it becomes maladaptive, as is the case for depressive rumination. She uses a multimodal approach that combines computational modeling, scalp and intracranial EEG, behavioral studies, and eye-tracking. In addition, she is interested in how meditation practice affects our cognitive system, and she investigates meditation in both Western practitioners and Tibetan monks.</p>

                                    <p class="service-item-text">Abstract: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common form of refractory epilepsy, suffer especially from cognitive issues in memory retention, spatial memory, and verbal memory. However the causes of cognitive impairment in TLE are unclear, in particular the relative contribution of factors such as epilepsy duration, long term AED use, burden of epileptiform activity present, and predisposition to neurodegeneration. At a whole-brain level, grey matter loss and cortical thinning and changes in functional connectivity networks have been implicated. In this talk I will discuss how intraregional oscillatory activity may be affected during spatial and associative memory formation in epilepsy, how epileptiform features such as interictal spikes have an impact, and how future approaches such as neural stimulation may remediate memory processing.</p>
                                    <p class="service-item-text">Bio: Dr Umesh Vivekananda undertook his PhD at the Institute of Neurology, UCL on the subject of presynaptic channelopathies. He continued his speciality training as part of an academic clinical lectureship at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, his research focussing on developing novel neurophysiological methods to epilepsy. He has published and taught on advanced analytic approaches to Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and was the first to report the use of Optically Pumped MEG in epilepsy.</p>

                                    <p class="service-item-text">Abstract: DataLad is a Python-based tool for the joint management of code, data, and their relationship, built on top of a versatile system for data logistics (git-annex) and the most popular distributed version control system (Git). It adapts principles of open-source software development and distribution to address the technical challenges of data management, data sharing, and digital provenance collection across the life cycle of digital objects. This talk introduces the tool and its main features for open science in brief.</p>
